Welcome! The <%= config.apiName %> allows developers to receive user-authorized bill data and make payments on behalf of a user. With over 5000 companies and counting, supercharge your platform with the <%= config.apiName %>. 

Here you will find information on how to integrate with and use the <%= config.apiName %>.

The <%= config.apiName %> uses standard HTTP [verbs](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) to communicate and HTTP [response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) to indicate status and errors.
