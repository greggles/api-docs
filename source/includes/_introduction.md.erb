Welcome! The <%= config.apiName %> allows developers to receive user-authorized bill data and make payments on behalf of a user.

Here you will find information on how to integrate with and use the <%= config.apiName %>. We've tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled, but please [drop us a line](mailto:api@unbill.us) with any questions. If you're planning to use our API in production, you should take a look at our [privacy policy](http://unbill.us/privacy.html).

The <%= config.apiName %> uses standard HTTP [verbs](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) to communicate and HTTP [response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard [JSON](http://www.json.org/). The <%= config.apiName %> is served over HTTPS to ensure data privacy, HTTP is not supported.
