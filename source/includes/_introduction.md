# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome! The Unbill API allows developers to receive user-authorized bill data and make payments on behalf of a user. With over 4000 billers and counting, supercharge your platform with the Unbill API. Here you will find information on how to integrate with and use the Unbill API. We've tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled, but please [drop us a line](mailto:hello@unbill.us) with any questions. If you're planning to use our API in production, you should take a look at our [privacy policy](http://unbill.us/privacy.html).
