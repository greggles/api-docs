## Company logos

The Unbill API provides image URL's for each company's logo. For our most popular companies, we also provide a white svg logo, along with the hex color of the company's brand. There are three ideal ways of presenting these logos in your apps.

1. When the `company.logo.svg` is available, the svg logo looks best on the `company.logo.svg.color` background.

2. When the `company.logo.svg` is not available and the `company.logo.background` field is set to `false`, the logo looks best on a white background.

3. When the `company.logo.svg` is not available and the `company.logo.background` field is set to `true`, the logo looks best as a background image with the company name overlaid on top.
