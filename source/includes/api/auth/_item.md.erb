## Auth items

> Sample Bill Item

```json
{
  "type": "bill",
  "balance": "100",
  "dueDate": "<%= config.futureDate %>"
}
```

After a successful authentication is made, a list of available `items` attached to an auth will be returned for convience. For more details about each of these items, access the items endpoints.
Currently only `bill` items are supported, but additional items like `usage` and `transactions` are coming soon!
