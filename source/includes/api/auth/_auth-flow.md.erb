## Auth flow

The authentication flow may vary depending on the company. Below you'll find approaches to test the possible flows within your app. For each flow set `form.password` to `test`.

### Basic Auth

The most common approach used by companies is a simple username & password combination. To test this set `form.username` to `test`.

### Multi-factor Authentication

Some companies require multi-factor authentication (MFA). To test this set `form.username` to `testmfaquestions` for a question based response or `testmfacode` for a code based response. In this response will be provided the `token` which you can then submit to the `/auth/step` endpoint to complete the authentication.

### Example Auth Items

An Auth may have various [items](#auth-items) linked to it. To test bill items you may set `form.username` to `testsyncing`, `testupcoming`, or `testpaid`.
