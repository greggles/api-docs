## Payment status

A payment method can have one of three statuses. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### verified

The payment method on file is verified and eligible to make payments.

### declined

The payment method on file is not eligible to make payments. This may happen for a number of reasons including:

- Insufficient funds
- Expired card
- Closed bank account

When a user's payment method fails to pay a bill, we set their payment method status as `declined`. While their status is `declined` no bill payments will be made in behalf of the user. To address this issue, you may take one of the following courses of action:

1. Link a new payment method via the `/payment` endpoint.
2. Retry the payment method via the `/payment/{paymentMethodId}/retry` endpoint.

If their payment method continues to be declined, it will be removed from their account. If the removed payment method was the default, the user will need to link a new payment method or choose another payment method on file as their default before bill payment services resume.
