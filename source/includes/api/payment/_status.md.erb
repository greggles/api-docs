## Payment status

A payment method can have one of two statuses. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### verified

The payment method record on file is verified as a valid payment method. When a `verified` status is returned, no action items are required by your users.

### failed

A user's payment method can fail to pay a bill for a number of reasons, some including:

- Insufficient funds
- Expired card
- Closed bank account

When a user's payment method fails to pay a bill, we set their payment method status as `failed`. While their status is `failed` no bill payments will be made in behalf of the user. In your apps, if the payment method status is `failed`, we require the user to complete one of two action items:

1. Add a new payment method.
2. Retry their payment method.

To have us retry their payment method again, make a request to the `/payment/retry` endpoint.

If their payment method fails again after a retry, their payment method will be removed and they will have to add another payment method to continue paying bills.
