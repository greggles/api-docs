A bill `status.type` can be a variety of types. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### syncing

Our system is currently retrieving data.

![Bill Syncing](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-syncing.png)

### zero-balance

Bill data is not available yet. Most common reason is that the user hasn't received a bill. (change image)

![Bill Zero Balance](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-zero-balance.png)

### overdue

The due date for the bill has passed, and no payment has been made. Common reasons for an overdue bill are:

- A user adds a bill that is already overdue.
- `autopay` is enabled and the user has no payment method or their payment method's status is `failed`.
- `autopay` is disabled and a payment has not been scheduled via the `/payment/make` endpoint.

![Bill Overdue](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-overdue.png)

### authenticate

The user's credentials no longer work with the company's website and need to be reauthenticated. Make a request to the `/auth` endpoint with updated credentials to remove this status.

![Bill Authenticate](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-authenticate.png)

### payment-required

The payment method specified by `company.requiredPayment` is required to pay this bill. A linked payment method must be assigned before bill payments will resume. This can be done via the `/payment/assign` endpoint.

![Payment required](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-authenticate.png)

### payment-declined

The payment method used to pay this bill was declined. To resume bill payments, have the user try their payment method again via the `/payment/retry` endpoint, or assign another one via the `/payment/assign` endpoint.

![Payment declined](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-authenticate.png)

### hold 

For a number of reasons a bill can have the status of `hold`. When a bill is on hold we'll present you with a `reason` that you in turn can present to your users. To remove this status, the user must take the appropriate action as described in the `reason`. This usually involves them needing to login into their online account. Once the user has completed the action, make a request to the `/bill/fix-hold` endpoint to resume their bill services.

*Display hold reason*

![Bill Hold](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-hold.png)

*Displayed after user returns to app*

![Bill Hold Confirm](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-hold-confirm.png)

### upcoming

The user has an outstanding balance on their account that will be paid in the future.

![Bill Upcoming](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-upcoming.png)

### pending

The user has an outstanding balance with a future due date.

![Bill Pending](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-pending.png)

### paid

The user has no outstanding balance and has a last paid amount on their account.

![Bill Paid](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-paid.png)
