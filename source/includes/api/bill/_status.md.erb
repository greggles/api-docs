A bill `status` can be a variety of types. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### syncing

There is no available bill balance at the moment. When a bill is first authenticated its status is `syncing` until a bill balance is retrieved. This typically takes no longer than 24 hours.

### overdue

There is currently a bill balance with a due date that is in the past and needs to be paid as soon as possible. A bill is typicallly overdue when:

- A user adds a bill that is already overdue.
- `autopay` is enabled and the user has no payment method or a payment method on hold.
- `autopay` is disabled and a payment has not been scheduled via the `/payment/make` endpoint.

### authenticate

The user's credentials no longer work with the company's website and need to be reauthenticated. Make a request to the `/auth` endpoint with updated credentials received from your user to remove this status.

### hold 

For a number of reasons a bill can have the status of `hold`. When a bill is on hold we'll present you with a `reason` that you in turn can present to your users. To remove this status, the user must complete whatever needs to be done with their online account as described in the `reason`.

You can also allow your user's to manually fix their bill holds in your app by making a request to the `/bill/fix-hold` endpoint.

### upcoming

The user has an outstanding balance on their account that will be paid in the future.
