A bill `status` can be a variety of types. Each type is documented below with a description of the status and a typical use case.

### syncing

Bill data is not available yet. Most common reason is that the user hasn't received a bill.

### overdue

The due date for the bill has passed, and no payment has been made. Common reasons for an overdue bill are:

- A user adds a bill that is already overdue.
- `autopay` is enabled and the user has no payment method or their payment method's status is `failed`.
- `autopay` is disabled and a payment has not been scheduled via the `/payment/make` endpoint.

### authenticate

The user's credentials no longer work with the company's website and need to be reauthenticated. Make a request to the `/auth` endpoint with updated credentials to remove this status.

### hold 

For a number of reasons a bill can have the status of `hold`. When a bill is on hold we'll present you with a `reason` that you in turn can present to your users. To remove this status, the user must take the appropriate action as described in the `reason`. This usually involves them needing to login into their online account. Once the user has completed the action, make a request to the `/bill/fix-hold` endpoint to resume their bill services.
