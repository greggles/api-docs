	"bill": {
		"headline": {
			"title": "$35.23 due on 5/7.",

A bill `headline` is a quick glance at the current state of a bill. It is available within the bill detail.

![Bill Headline](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-headline.png)

Each headline includes a `title`, `type`, optional `subtitle`, and optional action `buttons` as documented below.

### title

The `title` describes the current state of a bil.

### type

The `type` describes the type of headline and is similar to the status of a bill. Possible values are `syncing`, `pending`, `paid`, `upcoming`.

### subtitle

The `subtitle` is additional helper text to more fully describe the state of the bill.

![Bill Subtitle](<%= config.s3 %>/bill-headline-subtitle.png)

### buttons

The `buttons` represent possible actions a user could take. For example, when `autopay` is disabled the `title` would say "$35.23 due on 5/7." and the button `text` would be "Pay Now". When the user clicks the "Pay Now" button, you would make a call the `/payment/make` endpoint after confirming with the user they want to pay off their balance.

Each button includes `text`, `type`, and `primary` fields. The `text` describes the action. Possible values of `type` are `pay-now` (schedule payments) and `bill-settings` (update autopay). When there are multiple buttons, `primary` dictates which button is most relevant to the user in the list of `buttons`.
