## Bill payment schedule

A bill's `settings.schedule` is the number of days before the due date when a bill will be paid. This schedule will be followed when `settings.recurring` is enabled and the company allows it.
<br><br>
The bill's `payDate` is the date in which the next bill payment will be made. When recurring payments are enabled, the `payDate` is calculated by the assigned `settings.schedule`. When recurring payments are disabled, one-time payments may be scheduled on-demand via the `/payment/schedule` endpoint. Available `settings.schedule` options are documented below.

### ten-days-before

A payment will be made ten days before the due date.

### five-days-before

A payment will be made five days before the due date.

### day-before

A payment will be made the day before the due date.

### on-due-date

A payment will be made on the due date.

### immediately

A payment will be made as soon as a new bill is received.
