## Errors

The <%= config.apiName %> uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with <%= config.brand %>'s servers (these are rare).

Code | Description
---- | -----------
200 - OK | Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request	| The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized | No valid API key provided.
402 - Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed.
404 - Not Found	| The requested resource doesn't exist.
429 - Too Many Requests	| Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on <%= config.brand %>'s end. (These are rare.)
