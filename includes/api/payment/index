<h1 id="payment-api">Payment API</h1>

<p>In order to make payments towards a user&rsquo;s bill, they must first have a payment method linked with Unbill. By default, after a payment method is linked, payments will be made towards a user&rsquo;s bills automatically and on time. The API allows you to add, retrieve, and make payments on behalf of the user.</p>
